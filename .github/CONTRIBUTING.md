# Contribution guidelines
## Which repository setup will we use?
We will use Git and GitHub for as many things as possible.

## Branching model
We use trunk-based development. That is, we branch out from `master` once we create a change, attempt to keep the change as minimal as possible, and merge back into `master` ASAP.

Commits to `master` directly are not allowed. All changes come from pull requests.

## Which distributed development workflow will we use?
We will make extensive use of GitHub, pull requests and issues being the main tools. These document the need for changes and implemented changes, respectively.

## How do we expect contributions to look like?
Individual contributions should simply follow the branching model: as small and simple as possible. Rather many pull requests than a single pull request with many commits.

Once a collection of contributions has been made and a release is ready, we will use GitHub's release system to document releases.

## Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
All PRs need two approving reviews (excluding the author) to merge into `master`. Reviews are performed by group members.
