\subsection{Software license compatibility}
To check if the software licenses of the libraries we've used are compatible with the MIT license in our repository, we have used lichen \cite{tool:lichen} to automatically check the licenses of all used libraries. This process is documented in \appendixref{appendix:software-license-check}. The results showed that all the libraries were compatible, except one because the tool couldn't find its license. However, checking its repository manually revealed a compatible MIT license.
