\subsubsection{Replacing database management systems}

At some point, we switched from SQLite to SQL Server. This could be done almost seamlessly due to the abstraction of our repository controllers, as described in section \ref{section:system-design}.
This abstraction was introduced in PR \#21, particularly \href{https://github.com/Devops-2022-Group-R/itu-minitwit/pull/21/commits/96d0ea601453ff9d3efe52c30b2435c6308f120b}{\color{blue}this commit}.
