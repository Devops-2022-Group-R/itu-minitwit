\subsubsection{Replacing database management systems}

We've switched from SQLite to PostgreSQL, and then later to SQL Server. This could be done almost seamlessly due to the abstraction of our repository controllers, as described in section \ref{section:system-design}.
In particular, to see how little change was required to switch to PostgreSQL, see PR \#34, particularly the changes to \texttt{main.go}, and how it interacts with \texttt{database/database.go} in commit b483145 \cite{commit:switching-to-psql}.
