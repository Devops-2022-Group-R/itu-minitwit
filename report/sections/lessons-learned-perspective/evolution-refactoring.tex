\subsection{Evolution and refactoring}

\subsubsection{Initial refactoring}

At the start of the project, we hosted a large collaborative session, using Live Share \cite{tool:live-share} to let everyone see the same context of the workspace of one developer, allowing us to co-edit and co-debug the same code.
In retrospect, perhaps it would have been better to commit a basic boilerplate app, and then have each developer slowly commit more changes.

Having attempted a 1:1-translation, we ended up with one large file. This is where we started separating responsibilities, moving them to smaller files, as well as moving the front-end to a separate repo.
