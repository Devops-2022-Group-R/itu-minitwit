\subsection{Operation}

\subsubsection{Uptime}

Naturally, we aimed for 100\% uptime, as is the spirit of DevOps. Unfortunately, we did not quite live up to this spirit during the Easter break, where the service was down for several days, without any of us putting in the effort to get it running again.


\subsubsection{Backwards compatibility in migrating URLs}

When we moved to Kubernetes, we found out that we couldn't test Ingress on the \texttt{swuwu} domain, so we moved the name servers. To ensure backwards compatibility, every link we've used at some point still works. Both of these root domains point to the same place:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \url{https://api.rhododevdron.dk/}
    \item \url{https://api.rhododevdron.swuwu.dk/}
\end{itemize}
