\subsection{Operation}

\subsubsection{Uptime}

We aimed for 100\% uptime, as is the spirit of DevOps. Unfortunately, we did not quite live up to this DevOps spirit during the Easter break, where the service was down for several days, because we ran out of student credits on Azure. Most of us were busy, so we knowingly let the problem remain until the week after, which is not the DevOps mindset.


\subsubsection{Backwards compatibility in migrating URLs}

When we moved to Kubernetes, we found out that we couldn't test Ingress on the \texttt{swuwu} domain, so we moved the name servers. To ensure backwards compatibility, every link we've used at some point still works.
Both of these domains point to the same place:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \url{https://rhododevdron.dk/}
    \item \url{https://rhododevdron.swuwu.dk/}
\end{itemize}
