\subsection{Git branching strategy}
We've applied trunk-based development, meaning we branch out from the main branch, have a branch that lives shortly until the changes are implemented, and then merge it directly into the main branch. This keeps unrelated changes separate and makes PRs easier to review and merge. It's worth noting that we don't utilize release branches from trunk-based development, because we release continuously for each merge into the main branch.
