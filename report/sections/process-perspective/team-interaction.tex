\subsection{Team interaction}

The team consists of 4 developers, who meet once or twice a week to work on the project. At each meeting, the developers discuss the tasks at hand, create issues, divide the work, and then spend the rest of the time working on their tasks. There is no hierarchy - only 4 like-minded developers who make decisions in unison.

New tasks are created as issues on GitHub and then assigned to the developers who will be working on them. Maintaining a set of issues on GitHub lets us keep an overview of the planned tasks, and allows for any of the developers to easily add a new task at any time.
