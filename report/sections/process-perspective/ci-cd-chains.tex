\subsection{CI/CD chains}

We use CircleCI as a continous integration and continous delivery platform, and have configured a workflow \cite{workflow:circleci} with jobs to build, test, and deploy our service, generate a changelog, as well as building our \LaTeX\ project. At the end of this section, there is a diagram (\autoref{fig:ci-cd-diagram}) showing our full CI/CD flow.

\subsubsection{Building, testing, and static analysis}

This part of the workflow quite simply installs the dependencies, and then builds and tests the project. Additionally it runs the following three static code analysis jobs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A Go linters runner: \texttt{golangci-lint}, which runs dozens of linters in parallel.
    \item A cyclomatic complexity calculator: \texttt{gocyclo}, to ensure that the code has low complexity. Otherwise, the job will exit with code 1 until we've refactored the functions in question.
    \item A developer security platform, \texttt{Snyk}, to find and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, and containers.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: add sources
Besides this, we have set up SonarCloud and Better Code Hub, which provide us with more general static code analysis. For the overall results of these two and some examples of warnings, see \appendixref{appendix:static-code-analysis-results}.

\subsubsection{Deploying our service}

CircleCI will also:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Publish a GitHub release when merging to the master branch
    \item Push our changes to the four images in Docker Hub (the server, frontend, Prometheus, and Grafana)
    \item Deploy by performing a rolling-update to the aforementioned services in Kubernetes
    \item Apply infrastructure changes via Terraform
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Generating a changelog, and building the \LaTeX\ project}

We use CircleCI Github Changelog Generator \cite{tool:changelog-generator} to generate a changelog based on our tags, issues, labels and pull requests on GitHub.

In order to include a build of the \LaTeX\ project in the CircleCI workflow, we've written a script to let CircleCI run a custom Docker image, build a PDF, and then commit it to the branch.
