\subsection{CI/CD chains}

We use CircleCI as a continous integration and continous delivery platform, and have configured a workflow \cite{workflow:circleci} with jobs to build, test, and deploy our service, generate a changelog, as well as building our \LaTeX\ project. See appendix \ref{appendix:workflow} for a full CI/CD workflow diagram.



\subsubsection{Building and testing}

This job quite simply installs the dependencies, and then builds and tests the project. Additionally it runs some static code analysis checks using a Go linters runner \texttt{golangci-lint}


\subsubsection{Deploying our service}




\subsubsection{Generating a changelog, and building the \LaTeX\ project}
