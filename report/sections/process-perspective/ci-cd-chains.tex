We use CircleCI as a continous integration and continous delivery platform, and have configured a workflow with jobs to build, test, and deploy our service, as well as generate a changelog \cite{workflow:circleci}.


\subsubsection{Building and testing}

This job quite simply installs the dependencies, and then builds and tests the project. Additionally it runs some static code analysis checks using a Go linters runner \texttt{golangci-lint}


\subsubsection{Deploying our service}




\subsubsection{Generating a changelog}
