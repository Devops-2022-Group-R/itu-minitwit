The plan so far
- [ ] Find changes in the report directory by using git diff between latest commit and previous 
    - [ ] split (git log -2 --format=format:%H) into an array? and use for git diff
    - [ ] use the current branch 
- [ ] build main.LaTeX by using the script 
- [ ] add changes and commit with [skip ci] 
- [ ] push the changes to github
