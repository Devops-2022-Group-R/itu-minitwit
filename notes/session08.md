We deviate from the official schedule this week. We will transfer our services to a Kubernetes cluster to make adding logging later easier.

## The Plan
- [ ] Fix Terraform
- [ ] Create Kubernetes cluster in Azure
- [ ] Create automated Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] Create Kubernetes pod definitions
   - [ ] Main API server
   - [ ] Monitoring setup
   - [ ] Frontend
- [ ] Set up persistent storage

## Terms that everyone should know
- Cluster
- Namespace
- Pod
- "Expose"
- Load balancer
- Ingres controller
- API gateway

We will likely not make use of some of the above (especially the bottom ones), but it's great to know about.
